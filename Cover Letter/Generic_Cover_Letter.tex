    \tdate \\

    To Whom It May Concern, \\

    I have learned of your need for a \position \ in \location \ from the University of Waterloo's JobMine and co-op program. I would very much like to attain this position with \company \ for \length, and I believe my work experience, education, and skills are more than adequate to do so. \\

    I have developed group and independent work skills through my previous co-op position as a Test Specialist with Agfa Healthcare in Waterloo, Ontario. There and through my education in Computer Science through the University of Waterloo, I have also gained skills in working with computers and programming in C, Java, BASIC, Turing, and Scheme. \\

    I have included within my resume, including precious work experience and all relevant qualifications. I look forward to discussing my candidacy for the position of \position \ at \company. \\

    Thank you for your time and for considering me as a suitable candidate for this position. \\

    Sincerely, \\
    Glenn Hartmann
